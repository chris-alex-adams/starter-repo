# Coin Dictionary Load

Job that loads coins full names and images into MongoDB from:

* resources/manifest.json
* resources/icon

Used the website here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/cryptocurrency-icons

This is only a limited set of coins so I'm relying on CoinRanking data for the images and full coin names.
